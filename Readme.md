GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

### ### Within the Password Generator, you will find: 
* A functioning timer that counts down on click on the start button
* clearly defined variables and functions within the javascript
* nice UI layout on the home / start screen 
* functioning alert system, (yeah, itâ€™s not right, but it works!) 
* the tears of my 30 year old self.
